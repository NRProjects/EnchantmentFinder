# Usage

Clone the repo, you will need to change the `directory_path` variable to the region directory you want to read from. You may also modify the `MAX_THREADS` variable to run this even faster. Once finished with that, run `cargo build --release` and run.

It will print out a `hash_dict.json` file in the same directory that it was ran from.
